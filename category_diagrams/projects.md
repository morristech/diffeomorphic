This is a sort of brain dump of the various things I have fluttering
around inside my head...

* Math projects
	* Readings
		* Lebl's analysis - I've forgotten much of my analysis,
		and I need a good boost before I'll be able to prove
		things confidently again.
		* Shifrin's algebra - I liked his text for the geometric
		approach he took to provide counterexamples for a lot
		of things. Was definitely helpful during my last two
		algebra courses.
		* Munkres - I have yet to break too heavily into
		topology. Need to find another text to complement
		this one...
		* Hatcher - Same with Munkres. Algtop doesn't seem
		sensible to look at until I've built up the proper
		background.
		* Axler's linear algebra - I've forgotten a couple of
		things when it comes to vector spaces, linear operators,
		etc.
* Computer projects
	* Personal storage
		* Time Machine for the retina MBP
		* Other disk enclosures for the ThinkPad
		* git annex
		* Tahoe-LAFS
			* Cluster at my apartment in Atlanta
			* Cluster at my house in Fairview Heights
			* Cluster at work
	* Massive scale projects
		* Raspberry Pi cluster
			* Cluster scheduler
			* Sandboxing
			* Instrumentation
	* Personal automation projects
		* Slack roles for the ThinkPad and retina MBP
* Reading projects
	* Reading list:
		* ...
