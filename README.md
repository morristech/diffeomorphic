# Diffeomorphic

In differential geometry, a diffeomorphism is a bijective map `f` between two
manifolds `M` and `N` for which maps `f':M->N` and `f^{-1}':N->M` exist, where
`f'` represents the derivative of `f` and `f^{-1}'` represents the derivative
of the inverse of `f`.

Furthermore, two manifolds are said to be diffeomorphic if there exists a
diffeomorphism between them.

In the context of this repository, the manifolds represent a playground and a
well-structured project respectively. I plan to ramble incoherently a lot here,
and the results of my rambling may have implications with respect to finished
projects. I may go backwards and reflect on what is finished.

If you are not me, I definitely welcome comments on my math and code.
