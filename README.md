# Diffeomorphic

In differential geometry, a diffeomorphism is a bijective map between two
manifolds such that the map is, basically but not exactly, everywhere
differentiable and everywhere continuous while also preserving these properties
with its inverse. The analogue in topology, a closely related field, is the
homeomorphism, and you can draw similarities to isomorphisms in algebra as
well.

In the context of this repository, the manifolds represent a playground and a
well-structured project. I plan to ramble a incoherently a lot here.
