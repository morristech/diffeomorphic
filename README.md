# Diffeomorphic

In differential geometry, a diffeomorphism is a bijective map `f` between two
manifolds `M` and `N` for which maps `f':M->N` and `f^{-1}':N->M` exist.

Furthermore, two manifolds are said to be diffeomorphic if there exists a
diffeomorphism between them.

In the context of this repository, the manifolds represent a playground and a
well-structured project respectively. I plan to ramble a incoherently a lot
here, and the results of my rambling may result in finished projects.
